# Let's scale a Node.js app natively on a Kubernetes cluster with HPA

Horizontal Pod Autoscaling can help you scale your app based on CPU, memory or custom metrics in Kubernetes. 

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment or replica set based on observed CPU utilization (or, with custom metrics support, on some other application-provided metrics).
